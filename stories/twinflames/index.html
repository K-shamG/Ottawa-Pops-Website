                    <li>
                      Twin Flames is an award-winning husband-and-wife duo made
                      up of Jaaji and Chelsey June. They sing songs in English,
                      Inuttitut and French.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Jaaji is Inuk and Mohawk from Nunavik and Chelsey June
                      métis (Algonquin Cree) from Ottawa.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Twin Flames push the boundaries of “Contemporary Folk”,
                      with songs that incorporate both Western and traditional
                      instruments.
                    </li>

                    Why did you choose these songs? Is there a greater, unifying
                    context to the playlist?
                  </h4></strong
                >
                <p>
                  Chelsey: “Definitely. All of the songs we chose are ones that
                  influenced our life, our music writing and our musical career.
                  The playlist is pretty much a walkthrough of how Twin Flames
                  was born from the very beginning. We first met in 2014 on the
                  television series, TAM (Talent Autochtones Musicaux), and our
                  instant connection through music. Neither of us were supposed
                  to be there on set, but with Jaaji’s last minute tour schedule
                  change and me getting there through a cancellation, we ended
                  up there on the same day.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jaaji: “Everyone was singing around the fire after filming,
                  and Chelsey started jamming with me on one of my cover songs.
                  When our voices met in harmony, everyone noticed how much we
                  clicked through song. Usually, harmonizing is something you
                  practice and learn with your band, but this was instantaneous.
                  Having grown up with the great harmonies of yesterday in my
                  ear, it was a very impacting moment between us and where it
                  all began.”

                <p>
                  Chelsey: “All of these pieces tie into our life and how we
                  were feeling at the time, so it’s kind of a journey through
                  our life experiences. It’s hard to choose, but there are a few
                  special pieces that stand out. Yellow by Coldplay, influenced
                  both of us deeply. I remember being so in awe of the sounds in
                  the song.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jaaji: “I totally agree. The piece is acoustic and simple, but
                  still so full of nuance. It’s simple but incredibly inspiring
                  at the same time.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chelsey: “ A lot of my musical influences come from my
                  subconscious, and my parents were both obsessed with music. I
                  vividly remember listening to Leaving on a Jet Plane by John
                  Denver, sitting on the floor with those huge 80s headphones.
                  Music was a different level of love for me, as I grew up in a
                  household as an only child, and watching a difficult
                  relationship between my parents. Music was an escape for me
                  for sure, and I think I learned that from my mom. I remember
                  her blasting Coming Around Again by Calry Simon, which talks
                  about marriage and babies and how hard it can get on a
                  relationship when the couple isn’t the focus. I loved the
                  melody of the song, but now the lyrics are really impacting
                  because I understand them as an adult. It was so fun to do
                  this exercise, to dig down and realize what we think about
                  this music and how it impacted us.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jaaji: “For me, being from an era when CDs were just coming
                  out, I remember my stepdad was the first guy to get a CD
                  player way up north, and it was a big deal. I grew up
                  listening to all the folk greats like Simon and Garfunkel, but
                  I was often listening to the cover versions from alternative
                  rock bands. Honestly, it was a bit of an emotional can of
                  worms opening up, looking back at the past and listening to
                  this music and then seeing/feeling how it influenced the
                  writing we have now with our pieces. Fleetwood Mac’s Rumours
                  was a big one. It’s really cool to see the musical influences
                  on our new album which is coming out in August.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chelsey: “This music is definitely personal to us. Especially
                  the pieces that we wrote or Jaaji wrote before Twin Flames.
                  Nunaga was the first song she heard Jaaji singing on the set
                  for TAM. I didn’t understand the language but I was totally
                  captivated by it. So much so that I would drive to work
                  listening to that song. It’s really special that we now sing
                  it together.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jaaji: “Ya, this piece has become an anthem for the north. I
                  wrote it in 2010 during a dark time when my son had been
                  hospitalized for an accident. I remember sitting in the
                  hospital and desperately wanting to go back to my innocence
                  and youth, to go back home where I grew up, way up north in
                  the Arctic. Suddenly, I saw these snowflakes falling outside
                  like they did during my childhood, and I hadn’t seen any
                  snowflakes that size anywhere else but home in the north. I
                  got nostalgic, picked up my mandolin, went to the washroom and
                  created Nunaga. Lots of art happens in the washroom, to be
                  honest. But I sang from my heart, and wrote the words on a
                  scrap of paper and not a single part of the lyrics or the
                  melody changed. People love this song for its relatability and
                  nostalgia. We’ve played it eight times in one night.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chelsey: “Another piece that we created together on this
                  playlist is Whispers in the Dark. Before we performed
                  together, I was working a government job and was so unhappy.
                  Jaaji finally convinced me to come on tour with him, but I was
                  scared of performing, of planes… of my own shadow. But I
                  joined him touring for the summer of 2015, exclusively touring
                  through the Arctic. It wasn’t instantly perfect by any means.
                  I was dealing with social anxiety and the reception to me, as
                  a white-looking indigenous woman that no one know, onstage
                  with Jaaji, who was a musical idol, it was tough. People
                  didn’t want me up there at first. So when I got home to
                  Ottawa, Jaaji and I wrote this call-and-answer style piece,
                  Whispers in the Dark, which is all about how neither of us are
                  alone because we have each other.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jaaji: “It’s also a huge testament to Chelsey and her huge
                  heart that she hung in there. She kept pushing and eventually
                  the reception shifted to love. She is now known as the ‘inlaw
                  to the north’ which is _______ in Inuttutit. I loved growing
                  Twin Flames with her. Even in the beginning, Chelsey had this
                  playlist that was different to what I normally listened to.
                  She loved The Civil Wars and they sounded like they were a
                  couple. Their song Dust to Dust had lyrics that fit like, ‘let
                  me hold your hand, we can dance around the flame / you’re like
                  a mirror reflecting me, takes one to know one so take it from
                  me’ It was great to think we could share this dream together,
                  too.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chelsey: “Sharing the dream together always makes us go, ‘as
                  if we get to live this, as if we are lucky enough to
                  experience this’. We have experienced some amazing moments
                  with fellow artists, too. We have Chosen by Rose Cousins on
                  our playlist because we met her during the Canada C3
                  reparation talks. We were chosen to perform for the full camp
                  and that’s where we met Rose. We felt transported, and I felt
                  that every word of her songs were chosen for me. I got to meet
                  her again at the Edmonton folk festival, and she brought me up
                  to jam. Jaaji is all about the melody but I find I am more
                  drawn to lyrics.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jaaji: “I definitely connect with the melody but there are
                  lyrics that really hit home for me, too. Porchlight from our
                  first debut album was never supposed to be ‘out there’ it was
                  really a song for us to cope with the issues around the
                  missing and murdered indigenous women of Canada and then the
                  song just became so important to us and our audience.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Chelsey: “For me, I grew up off the reserve and while I was
                  told as a child to be proud of my Métis culture but I didn’t
                  know what that meant. My mom was even told to be afraid to
                  talk about her Métis background. Rediscovering my culture
                  through my adolescence and adult life has been so important.”

                  Chelsey: “We want our music to help audiences within
                  communities to feel proud and that they have a voice in this
                  world. As an indigenous woman, I want to use my voice to bring
                  about change and understanding in non-indigenous communities.
                  We want to make the conversation around reconciliation and
                  understanding, accessible. We don’t want people to feel guilty
                  or that they need to apologize, but we want to encounter our
                  audience with open and honest hearts so we can give our
                  brothers and sisters a voice by singing songs in their own
                  languages, and to give non-indigenous people a deeper
                  understand of us and of indigenous people in Canadian history,
                  because a lot has been left out. But our main message is that
                  the world needs a lot more love and this is always at the
                  forefront of our music and our message. Music is the
                  soundtrack of our entire lives, and we’re just so glad people
                  are listening, especially our youths.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Jaaji: “Absolutely. Our hope is always that maybe they’ll turn
                  on the song and realize that they can do anything with their
                  lives and that nothing is impossible. The outlets are there,
                  music, sports, poetry, hunting… We just want to encourage our
                  listeners to follow their dreams. I became a cop when I got
                  out of high school because I needed to support my child, I
                  never thought I would be a musician but it happened. But in
                  our communities and our world, there is a huge need to
                  encourage people to follow their dreams, especially our youth.
                  I have a younger brother and many friends that have committed
                  suicide, and we are desperate for this epidemic to stop and
                  for our youth to see how much they can accomplish. We get mail
                  from fans saying ‘your song saved my life, I was ready to go
                  but there was a kid outside the shed playing one of your
                  songs, and I didn’t follow through’. Getting that kind of a
                  message gives us so much joy, but we’ve also gotten messages
                  from people saying ‘Thank you for the music, but they can’t go
                  on living’. One life lost is too many, so we are here to tell
                  people they matter and can achieve their dreams.”

                <p>
                  Chelsey: “Absolutely. I remember my own feelings of singing
                  alone and only to myself. At 26, I finally decided to try song
                  writing, just for me. And then when I started making an album,
                  I was only doing it to show my children that they could do
                  anything they wanted, ‘if mommy can do it, you guys can do
                  it’. From doing my first recording session, where I had to
                  face away from the tech team because I was so nervous, to
                  finally being onstage and seeing the audience sing my own
                  songs back with me, it was surreal. I realized I could connect
                  with people and share my voice with them. Having Jaaji onstage
                  was that extra security blanket, and a wonderful team of
                  musicians and an incredible producer… We’ve just been so
                  lucky. And we want to use that to show people that they can
                  follow and work for their dreams, too.”

                  should or shouldn’t be listening to instead of making their
                  own choice. We’ve all grown up with all kinds of music in
                  those cd rack card holders and it’s okay to like what you
                  like! I don’t ever expect anyone to like our music, if they
                  don’t, good for the next band that they do like. It’s okay to
                  love what you love, music is so important and deserves to be

                  learn more about our stories… not just ours but the whole
                  history of our people. Also, our stories that dreams do come
                  true and you can work for your dreams. We really would love to
                  be featured in a commercial singing in English and Inuttitut,

                  artists. It isn’t non-essential, and when we have so many big
                  corporations asking us to play for free or for ‘exposure’, it
                  doesn’t make sense that we are ‘essential’ to making their
                  company meeting or fundraiser a success, but we are considered
                  non-essential when it comes to money. Art is so important, so
